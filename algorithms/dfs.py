It is a buggy DFS, the "not visited[row][col]" in
    if is_valid(row, col) and grid[row][col].color != BLACK and not visited[row][col]:
make it travel every other line. Hence it could miss the goal.

Attempts made:
    1. add break in the movement for loop
        - it only works like normal DFS under a limited case.
        - it always have stack length of 1.
        - it will trap in a dead end.
    2. add a short-cut in the for loop
        - it will stop if the neighbor is the goal, hence it will not skip the goal.

Make it a normal DFS needs:
    1. a way to add enough neighbours to keep it running, so it can backtrack 
        - need another list?
        - or start with a stack, which alrealy has some things in it and add the start point?
